# Pandas-Challenge
The information provided to us shows different schools throughout an area. With this schools we get the information of the scores they had on several exams.
Our goal of this reseach was to see how different factors of schools affect perofrmance on the students of each school as the city board wants to have an idea of how to build an ideal school.
We conducted our anaylsis by seing if the type of school, the budget they had, and the size of the school influeced the students performance.
We did this by merging data, adding columns, and editing tables so that the information can become more readible. This process was performed through pandas in order for us to see our results while working. 
After concluding our analysis, we have uncovered several things:
-First, we see discovered an interseting discovery in which less budget per student (<$585) lead to a higher overall performance.Its important to consider that other factors such as the size of school could be influencing the budget per student.
-Secondly, size of the school performance was that medium size schools barely out performed small schools, but there was a clear difference with large schools. Having bigger school could lead to students not having that much attention on them to improve.
Third, charter schools vs district schools was the most clear difference in performance. They clearly perform better (90% vs 54%).
Therefore, we recommend the city board to consider building charter schools that are either medium sized or small sized. I believe those are the two strongest indicators to have to build schools that perform well in subjects such as math and reading.
